### Steps to Create a New Repository

1. Created a directory to store the project.
2. Use the touch command to create the README.md. file to satisfy the github repository requirements.
3. Use the `git add .` command to stage everything to be commited.
4. Use `git commit -m ' initial commit'` to create a root commit for the master.
5. Go to use github.com/new to create a new public remote repository.
6. Use the copy to clipboard to pull the ssh url to supply the `git remote add origin` with the url.

7. Use  `git push -u origin master` to set the default upstream location origin for the repository and establish the master branch in github.
